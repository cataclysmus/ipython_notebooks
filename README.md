# Example Binder with requirements.txt

A Binder-compatible repo with a `requirements.txt` file.

The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that your notebooks depend on, and they will be installed using 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that many scientific Python libraries (e.g. `numpy`, `scipy`, `sklearn`, etc.) are included already because the image for Binder is built on Anaconda.
