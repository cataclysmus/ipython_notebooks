# Example Binder with requirements.txt

A Binder-compatible repo with a `requirements.txt` file.

The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that your notebooks depend on, and they will be installed using 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run it from mybinder.org [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/cataclysmus/misc_game)
